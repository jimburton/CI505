# CI505

Lab exercises and summative tests for the CI505 module at the
University of Brighton. Most of them will take longer than a single
lab session to complete so use them for independent study. Also, once
the assignment is available you may prefer to carry on working on that
-- later exercises are provided for people who want some extra
practice with Haskell. 

## Week 1

[Basic terms](labs/Week0.org) and [getting started](labs/week1/Week1.md).

## Week 2

[More practice with lists](labs/week2/Week2.md).

## Week 3

Read the information on the [Haskell dev
environment](labs/DEV.md). Carry on using a basic editor if you prefer to. Follow the instructions
on using `cabal`, the Haskell build tool.

## Week 4

[In-class test](in-class-tests/test1/README.md). Now is the
time for you to get an idea of your progress. Complete the exercises
and submit on studentcentral **before the end of week 5** in order to
receive feedback onilne, or approach your tutor in a lab session for
feedback in person.

## Week 5

**Start work on the assignment**. From now on you can carry on working
on this in between working on the subsequent exercises.

You should also look at [How to pronounce Haskell operators](etc/OP-NAMES.md).

If you want an additional exercise this week, have a go at 
[working with typeclasses](labs/Typeclasses.md). 

## Week 6

[Parsing (by hand) and IO exercises](labs/parsing/README.md).

## Week 7

TODO

## Week 8

In the lectures this week we discussed the [Scrabble project](https://github.com/jimburton/scrabble).
Read the first chapter and complete the exercises at the end of it.

## Week 9

Read chapter two of the [Scrabble project](https://github.com/jimburton/scrabble).
and complete the exercises at the end of it.

## Week 10

Complete the exercise on the
[change](https://github.com/jimburton/change) repository to make it
use the `State` monad.

## Week 11

[Parsing using AttoParsec](https://github.com/jimburton/simple-log-parser).

## Week 12 

[Webservices with Haskell](https://github.com/jimburton/haskell-webservice/blob/master/README.md). 
Note that this time-consuming exercise lives in its own repository. Although you may not have
time to complete it, you can always use it as a basic reference on the Happstack web framework.
